Abstract: 

Biometric cryptosystems offer a promising avenue for secure authentication, yet errors in biometric data can compromise their efficiency and security. Existing systems often employ error-correction codes but may overlook the distribution of biometric sources, risking underestimation of system security. To address this, we propose ENCODE and DECODE, algorithms facilitating direct codeword generation from biometric samples. Our method considers the distribution of biometric sources, yielding a more accurate security estimation compared to traditional methods. The generated codewords retain interpretability and sensitivity to cosine distance between original biometric samples, well-suited for high-dimensional data analysis and precise performance assessment. Rigorous validation confirms the correctness of our algorithm pair, with empirical results demonstrating efficacy in tolerating distance between codewords while preserving accuracy in cosine distance-sensitive contexts. This approach holds promise for significantly enhancing the efficiency and security of biometric cryptosystems, making them more suitable for daily cryptographic applications.
